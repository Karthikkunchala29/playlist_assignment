Audio Player Script with Shuffle, Pause, Resume, Skip, and Quit Functionality

The audio player script is designed to provide a flexible and interactive solution for playing a collection of audio files. It allows for randomized playback without repetition, and includes options to pause, resume, skip to the next song, and quit the program. This report provides an overview of the code implementation, the libraries involved, and how the code works.

[Code Execution]

The code is implemented in Python and utilizes the Pygame library for audio playback. It also incorporates the Numpy library for shuffling the list of audio files. The main execution of the code can be summarized as follows:

1. Import Libraries: The script starts by importing the necessary libraries, including Pygame and Numpy.

2. Define Audio Files: A list of audio files is created, representing the collection of songs to be played.

3. Initialize Pygame Mixer: The Pygame mixer is initialized to set up the audio playback functionality.

4. Shuffle Audio Files: The list of audio files is shuffled using the Numpy library's `numpy.random.shuffle()` function. This ensures a random order of songs for playback without repetition.

5. Play Audio Files: The shuffled audio files are played one by one within a loop. The Pygame mixer's `pygame.mixer.music` module is used to load and play the audio files.

6. Handle User Commands: The script waits for user input to handle commands such as pause, resume, skip, or quit. The user is prompted to enter a specific command.

7. Pause and Resume Functionality: If the user enters the 'p' command, the audio playback is paused using the `pygame.mixer.music.pause()` function. Similarly, the 'r' command resumes the paused playback using the `pygame.mixer.music.unpause()` function.

8. Skip Functionality: The 's' command allows the user to skip the current song and move to the next one. This is achieved by stopping the current playback using the `pygame.mixer.music.stop()` function.

9. Quit Option: The 'q' command stops the playback and exits the program. It clears the remaining audio files and breaks out of the loop.

10. Clean Up Resources: After the loop ends, the Pygame mixer is terminated using the `pygame.mixer.quit()` function to release system resources.

LIBRARIES:

The script utilizes the following libraries:

1. Pygame: A library that provides functions for audio playback, including loading, playing, pausing, and stopping audio files.

2. Numpy: A library that offers various mathematical and array manipulation functions. In this script, Numpy is used for shuffling the list of audio files.

HOW THE CODE WORKS:

The code works by creating a list of audio files and shuffling them randomly using the Numpy library. It then enters a loop where it plays each audio file in the shuffled order. The script listens for user commands to control the playback. The 'p' command pauses the playback, 'r' resumes it, 's' skips to the next song, and 'q' quits the program.
